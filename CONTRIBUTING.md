## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We will use GitHub's pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript

- Prefer ES6 classes over prototypes.
- Use strict equality checks (`===` and `!==`) except when comparing against (null or undefined).
- Prefer arrow functions `=>`, over the function keyword except when defining classes or methods.
- Use semicolons at the end of each statement.
- Prefer single quotes.
- Use `PascalCase` for classes, `lowerCamelCase` for variables and functions, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants, `_singleLeadingUnderscore` for private variables and functions.
- Prefer promises over callbacks.
- Prefer array functions like `map` and `forEach` over for loops.
- Use `const` for declaring variables that will never be re-assigned, and let otherwise.
- Avoid `var` to declare variables.
- Use a trailing comma after each item in a multi-line array or object literal, including the last item.

To use the code linter, run

    npm run lint

### Checking for repo permissions
```bash
npm run checkPermissions
```
This will check if all the required permissions are satisfied but does not start the bot service. This same step is performed automatically before deploying the bot and will fail fast if the permissions are not granted.


## Testing
PR bot uses `Jest` for testing. Ensure that dev dependency is installed. To run tests during development:

    npm run testDev

All test files should be named `*.test.js` and reside in the `test` directory.
Jest is [configured to watch](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/cli.html#watchall) for changes.


## Adding dependencies

For all dependencies (both installation and development):

- **Do not add** a dependency if the desired functionality is easily implementable.
- If adding a dependency, it should be well-maintained and trustworthy.

A barrier for introducing new installation dependencies is especially high:

- **Do not add** installation dependency unless it's critical to project success.
