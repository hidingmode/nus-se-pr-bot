Hi @{{username}}, your pull request title is invalid.

The PR name should be in the format of `[Learning Outcome ID][Team ID] Your Name`, where `[Learning
Outcome ID]` has no dashes or spaces (e.g. `[W3.1a]`) and `[Team ID]` has one dash only and no spaces (e.g. `[W14-2]` means `W`ednesday 2pm (`14` hrs), Team `2`).

Please follow the above format strictly and edit your title for reprocessing.
